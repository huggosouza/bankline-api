# Bankline API

A REST API using Spring Boot, hibernate, JPA, Maven etc.

I needed to add some lines in pom.xml so I could build it on Heroku.

I've written this code in Santander Dev Week Bootcamp, so I haven't done anything alone, I've acquired many experience with it and understood many concepts I wasn't familiriazed yet and I'm very happy with it.
